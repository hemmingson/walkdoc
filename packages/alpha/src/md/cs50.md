# CS50 React Native

> Jordan Hayashi

Javascript is interpreted, means it will execute code line by line.

Each browser has built-in javascript engine, it will do some magic and just-in-time compilation.

- V8
  - Node.js(a command line javascript runtime)
  - Chrome
- SpiderMonkey
  - Firefox
- JavascriptCore
  - Safari
- Chakra
  - Microsoft Edge/IE

They each implement the ECMA(European Computer Manufactures Association)Script standard.

But may differ for anything not defined by the standard.

## Types

- Dynamic typing
- Primitive types(no methods, immutable)
  - undefined
  - null
  - boolean
  - number
  - string
  - (symbol)
- Objects
- Coercion Typecasting
  - explicit
  - implicit
  - == vs. ===
    - == coerces the types
    - === requires equivalent types
  - typeof
    - typeof null is object(if change the whole internet would break)
  - falsy values
    - undefined
    - null
    - false
    - +0, -0, NaN
    - ""
  - truthy values
    - {}
    - []
    - Everthing else

```js{2}
const x = 26
const explicit = String(x)
const implicit = x + ''
```

## Objects

If it's not one of those primitive values, it's an object.

- Primitives vs. Objects
  - Primitives are immutable
  - Objects are mutable and stored by reference

```js
const o = new Object()
const o2 = {} // preferred way

const o3 = { 1: 'test' } // 1 will cast to string
o3['1'] // 'test'
o3[1] // anything between the brackets will get coerced into string

const o4 = Object.assign({}, o3) // shallow copy

// deep copy
function deepCopy(obj) {
  const keys = Object.keys(obj)
  const newObj = {}

  for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
    const key = keys[i]

    if (typeof obj[key] == 'object') {
      newObj[key] = deepCopy(obj[key])
    } else newObj[key] = obj[key]
  }

  return newObj
}
```

## Prototypal Inheritance

- Non-primitive types have a few properties/methods associated with them
- Each object stores a reference to its prototype
- Properties/methods defined most tightly to the instance have priority
- Most primitive types have object wrappers
- JS will automatically `box` (wrap) primitive values so you have access to methods
- Recommend against changing prototype

```js
const arr = []

arr.__proto__ // array prototype
arr.__proto__.__proto__ // object prototype

26.__proto__ // error!
const num = 26
num.__proto__ // [Number: 0]
num instanceof Number // false
```

## Scope

- Variable lifetime(how long these variables actually exist)
  - Lexical scoping(var): from when they're declared until when their function ends
  - Block scoping(let, const): until the next `}` is reached
- Hoisting
  - Function definitions are hoisted, but not lexically-scoped initializations

```js
thisIsHoisted() // Hi!
console.log(a) // undefined -> hoisting take the definition of something and hoist to the very top of the file and does that first
console.log(o) // error! -> block scoping variable is declared at the line that it is written
const o = {}
o = {} // error!

var a = 'a'
var a = 'b' // shadowing
console.log(a) // 'b'
// let a = 'a' // error!

function thisIsHoisted() {
  console.log('Hi!')
}
```

## The Javascript Engine

- Before executing the code, the engine reads the entire file and will throw a syntax error if one is not found
  - Any function definitions will be saved in memory
  - Variale initializations will be run, but lexically-scoped variable names will be declared
- Execution phase whereby the code is actually run, it's when things like const or let get invoked, or get both declared and initialized

## The Global Object

- All variables and functions are actually keys or parameters and methods on the global object
  - Browser global object is the `window` object
  - Node.js global object is the `global` object

```js
var x = 'x'
window.x // 'x'

const y = 'y'
window.y // undefined
```

## Closures

- Functions that refer to variables declared by parent function still have access to those variables
- Possible because of scoping

```js
// closure weird thing
function makeArray() {
  const arr = []

  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    arr.push(function () {
      console.log(i)
    })
  }

  console.log(i) // 5
  return arr
}
const arr = makeArray()
arr[0]() // 5

function makeHelloFunction() {
  const message = 'Hello!'

  function sayHello() {
    console.log(message)
  }

  return sayHello
}
// console.log(message) // error!
console.log('typeof message:', typeof message) // typeof message: undefined
const sayHello = makeHelloFunction()
console.log(sayHello.toString())
sayHello() // Hello!
```

## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

- A function expression that gets invoked immediately
- Creates closure
- Doesn't add to or modify global object

```js
// create same closure without actually creating a globally scoped function is an IIFE
const sayHello = (function () {
  const message = 'Hello!'

  function sayHello() {
    console.log(message)
  }

  return sayHello
})()
sayHello() // Hello!

// use case
const counter = (function () {
  let count = 0 // can't access count variable

  return {
    inc: function () {
      count += 1
    },
    get: function () {
      console.log(count)
    },
  }
})()

// use IIFE to solve buggy
function makeArray() {
  const arr = []

  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    arr.push(
      (function (x) {
        return function () {
          console.log(x)
        }
      })(i)
    )
  }

  return arr
}
const arr = makeArray()
arr[0]() // 0
```

## First-Class Functions

- Functions are treated the same way as other value
  - Can be assigned to variables, array values, object values
  - Can be passed as arguments to other functions
  - Can be returned from functions
- Allows for the creation of higher-order functions
  - Either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function
  - `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`

```js
const arr = ['0', 1, 2]
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
console.log(arr.reduce(add)) // '012'
console.log(arr.reduce(add, 'from ')) // 'from 012'
```

## Synchronous, Async, Single-Threaded

- JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous language
- A function that takes a long time to run will cause a page to become unresponsive
- JavaScript has function that act asynchronously
- It can be both synchronous and asynchronous

```js
function hang(secs) {
  const doneAt = Date.now() + secs * 1000
  while (Date.now() < doneAt) {}
}
hang(10) // stuck for 10s
```

## Asynchronous JavaScript

- Asynchronous functions
  - `setTimeout()`
  - `XMLHttpRequest()`, jQuery.ajax(), `fetch()`
  - Database calls
- Execution stack
  - Functions invoked by other functions get added to the call stack
  - When functions complete, they are removed from the stack and the frame below continues executing
- Browser APIs
  - Functions that are not built into javascript, but might get run in the browser
- Function queue
- Event loop
  - First checking is there anything in the stack
  - If stack is empty, check is there anything in the queue that's ready to go onto the stack

```js
function print(num) {
  console.log(num)
}
// result: 2 1 0
setTimeout(function () {
  print(0)
}, 2000)
setTimeout(function () {
  print(1)
}, 0)
print(2)
```

## Callbacks

- Control flow with asynchronous calls
- Execute function once asynchronous call returns value
  - Program doesn't have to halt and wait for value

## Promises

- Alleviate "callback hell"
- Allows you to write code that assumes a value is returned within a success function
- Only needs a single error handler

```js
const url = ''
fetch(url) // returns a promise
  .then(function (res) {
    return res.json() // extract the json out of this result
  })
  .then(function (json) {
    return {
      importantData: json.importantData,
    }
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data)
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    // handle error here
  })
```

## Async/Await

- Introduced in ES2017
- Allows people to write async code as if it were synchronous
- Mostly inside try-catch block

## this

- Refers to an object that's set at the creation of a new execution context(function invocation)
- In the global execution context, refers to global object
- If the function is called as a method of an object, `this` is bound to the object the method is called on
  - It's kind of a way of using a value that we don't yet know what it's going to be until we go ahead and invoke that function

```js
// node REPL
this // global object
// chrome console
this // window object

const person = {
  name: 'hem',
  greet: function () {
    console.log(this.name)
  },
}
person.greet() // 'hem'
const greet = person.greet
greet() // undefined
const friend = {
  name: 'david',
}
friend.greet = person.greet
friend.greet() // 'david'
```

## Setting 'this' manually

- `bind()`, `call()`, `apply()`
  - Difference between bind and call and apply is that call and apply rather than returning a new function, call and apply will IIFE
- ES6 arrow notation
  - Will actually bind 'this' to be whatever 'this' is at the time that function is declared, rather than at the time that function is invoked

```js
const person = {
  name: 'hem',
  greet: function () {
    console.log(this.name)
  },
}
const greet = person.greet.bind({ name: 'bound object' }) // explicitly bound this in this particular function to be this particular object
greet() // 'bound object'
// person.greet.call({ name: 'bound object' })
// person.greet.apply({ name: 'bound object' })
```

## Browsers and the DOM

- Browsers render HTML to a webpage
- HTML: defines a tree-like structure
- Browsers construct this tree in memory before painting the page
- Tree is called the Document Object Model
- The DOM can be modified using JavaScript

## Classes

- Syntax introduced in ES6
- Simplifies the definition of complex objects with their own prototypes
- Classes vs instances
- Methods vs static methods vs properties
- new, constructor, extends, super
  - constructor method in order to go ahead and construct an instance of this class

```js
class MySet extends Set {
  constructor(arr = []) {
    super(arr) // run original set's constructor
    this.originalArray = arr
  }

  add(val) {
    super.add(val) // super refers to the class is extended
    console.log('added ' + val + ' to the set!')
  }

  toArray() {
    return Array.from(this) // pass in entire instance
  }

  reset() {
    return new MySet(this.originalArray)
  }
}
```

## React

- Allows us to write declarative views that `react` to change data automatically
- Allows us to abstract complex problems into small components
- Allows us to write simple code that is still performant

## Imperative vs Declarative

- How vs What
  - How you do something and actually what you want out of it
- Imperative programming outlines a series of steps to get to what you want
- Declarative programming just declares what you want

## React is Declarative

- Imperative vs Declarative
- The browser APIs aren't fun to work with
- React allows us to write what we want, and the library will take care of the DOM manipulation

## React is Easily Componentized

- Breaking a complex problem into discrete components
- Can reuse these components
  - Consistency
  - Iteration speed
- React's declarative nature makes it easy to customize components

## React is Performant

- We write what we want and React will do the hard work
- Reconciliation - the process by which React syncs changes in app state to the DOM
  - Reconstructs the virtual DOM
  - Diffs the virtual DOM against the real DOM

## Writing React

- JSX
  - XML-like syntax extension of JavaScript
  - Transpiles to JavaScript
  - Lowercase tags are treated as HTML/SVG tags, uppercase are treated as custom components
- Components are just functions
  - Returns a node (something React can render, e.g. a `<div />`)
  - Receives an object of the properties that are passed to the element
- Props
  - Passed as an object to a component and used to compute the returned node
  - Changes in these props will cause a recomputation of the returned node ("re-render")
  - Unlike in HTML, these can be any JS value
- State
  - Adds internally-managed configuration for a component
  - "this.state" is a class property on the component instance
  - Can only be updated by invoking `this.setState()`
    - Implemented in React.Component
    - setState() calls are batched and run asynchronously
    - Pass an object to be merged, or a function of previous state

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    }
    // this.increaseCount = () => this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
  }

  increaseCount() {
    // merge {count: 0}, {count: this.state.count + 1}, {count: this.state.count + 1}
    // this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
    // this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
    // console.log(this.state.count) // 0

    this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 })) // updater function
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{this.props.count}</h2>
        <button onClick={this.increaseCount.bind(this)}>Increase</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

let count = 0
setInterval(function () {
  render(<App count={count++} />, document.getElementById('root'))
}, 1000)
```

## React Native

- A framework that relies on React core
- Allows us build mobile apps using only JavaScript
  - "Learn once, write everywhere"
- Supports iOS and Android

## How does React Native work?

- JavaScript is bundled
  - Transpiled and minified
- Separate threads for UI, layout and JavaScript
- Communicate asynchronously through a "bridge"
  - JS thread will request UI elements to be shown
  - JS thread can be blocked and UI will still work

## Differences between RN and Web

- Base components
- Style
- No browser APIs
  - CSS animations, Canvas, SVG, etc.
  - Some have been polyfilled (fetch, timers, console, etc.)
- Navigation

## React Native Components

- Not globally in scope like React web components
  - `import from "react-native"`
- div -> View
- span -> Text
  - All text must be wrapped by a `<Text />` tag
- button -> Button
  - Touch handler use onPress instead of onClick
- ScrollView

## Style

- React Native uses JS objects for styling
- Object keys are based on CSS properties
- Flexbox layout
  - Default to column layout
- Lengths are in unitless numbers
- `style` prop can take an array of styles
- `StyleSheet.create()`
  - Functionally the same as creating objects for style
  - Additional optimization: only sends IDs over the bridge
  - Every time rendered just use object reference outside the component

## Event Handling

- Unlike web, not every component has every interaction
- Only a few "touchable" components
  - Button
  - TouchableOpacity, TouchableHighlight, TouchableWithoutFeedback
  - TouchableNativeFeedback (Android only)
- Web handlers will receive the event as an argument, but React Native handlers often receive different arguments
  - Consult the docs

## Components

- Return a node (something that can be rendered)
- Represent a discrete piece of UI
- "All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props"
- Two types:
  - Stateless Functional Component (SFC) a.k.a. Pure Functional Component
  - React.Component

## Stateless Functional Component (SFC)

- Simplest component: use when you don't need state
- A function that takes props and returns a node
  - Should be "pure" (It should not have any side effects like setting values, updating arrays, etc.)
- Any change in props will cause the function to be re-invoked

## React.Component

- An abstract class that can be extended to behave however you what
- These have additional features that SFCs don't
  - Have instances
  - Maintain their own state
  - Have lifecycle methods (similar to hooks or event handlers) that are automatically invoked
- Rendering now becomes a function of props and class properties

## Mount

- constructor(props)
  - Initialize state or other class properties (bound methods, etc.)
- render()
  - The meat of a component
  - Return a node
- componentDidMount()
  - Do anything that isn't needed for UI (async actions, etc.)
  - Setting state here will cause a re-render before updating the UI

## Update

- componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)
  - Update any state fields that rely on props
- shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
  - Compare changed values, return true if the component should rerender
    - If return false, the update cycle terminates
- render()
- componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
  - Do anything that isn't needed for UI (network requests, etc.)

## Unmount

- componentWillUnmount()
  - Clean up
    - Remove event listeners
    - Invalidate network requests
    - Clear timeouts/intervals

## Expo

- "The fastest way to build an app"
- Suite of tools to accelerate the React Native development process
  - Snack - runs React Native in the browser
  - XDE - a GUI to serve, share, and publish your Expo projects
  - CLI - a command-line interface to serve, share and publish projects
  - Client - runs your projects on your phone while developing
  - SDK - bundles and exposes cross-platform libraries and APIs

## Import/Export

- Components are great for simplifying code
- We can split components into their own files
  - Helps organize project
  - Export the component from the file
- Import the component before using it in a file
- Default vs named import/export

```js
// Count.js
export default Count // default export limit only 1
export const Count = props => {}
export default props => {}
export const num = 0

// App.js
import CustomCount, { num } from './Count.js'
import { Count, num } from './Count.js'

// syntax
import * as name from ""
import defaultExport, { export1, export2 as alias2 } from ""

// dynamic import
(async () => {
  if(flag) const { default: myDefault } = await import('')
}) // need to destruct and rename default key
import('').then(module => {})
let module = await import('')
```

## PropTypes

- React can validate the types of component props at runtime
- Development tool that allows developers to ensure they're passing correct props
- Helps document your component's APIs
- Only runs in development mode

```js
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

// for functional component
Count.propTypes = {
  count: PropTypes.number.isRequired
} // outside function

// for class component better way
static propTypes = {} // inside class
```

## How to Read Docs

- Have a goal in mind
- See what the library/framework/API offers
- Find something that solves your problem
- Configure using the exposed API
